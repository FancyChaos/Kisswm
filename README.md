# Kisswm
**Kisswm** is a dead simple window manager inspired a lot by [DWM](https://dwm.suckless.org/).


This window manager is not ready for daily use yet.
It is missing some very important features and is not even ICCM/EWMH compliant.
Tho I already use it together with [kissbar](https://github.com/FancyChaos/Kissbar) on one of my machines.

## Configuration
The configuration is done solely inside the *kisswm.h* file.

## Installation
> make

> doas make install

## Why?
I had the urge to write my own window manager and so I did.
Not really meant to be used by other people (yet) because it is highly tailored to my personal needs.
