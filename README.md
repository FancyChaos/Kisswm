# Kisswm

**Kisswm** is a dead simple and strictly tiling window manager inspired a lot
by [DWM](https://dwm.suckless.org/).

It features basic ICCM/EWMH compliance and common navigation functionalities.

## Configuration

The configuration is done solely inside the *kisswm.h* file.

## Installation

> make

> doas make install

## Why?

I had the urge to write my own window manager and so I did.
Not really meant to be used by other people (yet) because it is highly tailored to my personal needs.
